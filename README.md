# The project assignment

In today's society, we see a constant development within IoT and smart homes. More and more people are using these smart solutions to save money or make everyday life more seamless. Unfortunately, we also see that this is currently reserved for people with high technical competence and a special interest in the field.

A startup wants to change this market and make it easier for the average person to benefit from this technological development.

The startup therefore wants to launch a platform that allows people, even without much technical expertise, to use such technology in their homes.
